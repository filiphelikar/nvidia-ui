Nvidia Desktop is a desktop application created using Electron, Vite, and React to display information about the graphics card. The backend of the application uses the `nvidia-smi` command to retrieve data from the console, which is then processed and displayed on the frontend. This project combines modern technologies for efficient hardware monitoring.
